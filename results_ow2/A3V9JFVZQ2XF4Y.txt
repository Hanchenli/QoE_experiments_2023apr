Bitrate degradation is annoying, and if it becomes severe it makes me less inclined to want to continue with a game, though it can't totally ruin the experience on by itself. Stalling, however, can be a severe impediment, and even the brief pauses as shown in the videos towards the middle-end of this survey can make a difference between life and death. I would stop playing (or watching!) if this were a persistent problem. The experiment guidelines are incredibly clear, and there was nothing confusing whatsoever about the grading or attention checks.
