Quality damage when playing a video game is much more frustrating and unacceptable than it being just a watching experience. If it's stalls, it is almost always unplayable if more than a split second long. Some reduced bitrates make it more difficult but not unplayable and at least there is some experience to be had if it's not combined with a stall or major drop in bitrate. If it's bad either way, it makes want to stop playing the game or watching something.
