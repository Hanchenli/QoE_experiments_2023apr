Experiment guidelines are fine, it'd be nice though if you added a skip for those of us that have done this series of tasks from you before. Doesn't really serve a purpose for us to watch the hitching/bitrate tanking. That said if I had to pick between playing singleplayer game and playing with any of the issues I witnessed in any of the videos in this task I'd just play single player. I sure as hell wouldn't play a comp shooter with these issues.
