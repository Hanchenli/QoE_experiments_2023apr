Bitrate decreases are an acceptable level of quality decrease because you still are in the flow of the game and it's just the picture quality downgrading. Having video stalls on the other hand is very disruptive and unplayable for me, I would never put up with the game freezing for a second or two every 15-20 seconds or whatever. I wasn't confused by anything.
