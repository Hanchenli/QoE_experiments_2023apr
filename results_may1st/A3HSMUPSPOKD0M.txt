I considered video stall to affect the overall experience more strongly than the bitrate drop. Both would be bad in this kind of Fortnite situation, but the stall/lag is what would get you killed the fastest (or make it the hardest to follow if you were watching a streamer play) I found the grading and the attention checks quite clear.
