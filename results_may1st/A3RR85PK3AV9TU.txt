In FPS gaming it's extremely important to be able to follow, track, and aim, so any hard freeze is really terrible for the player. Bitrate decreases can still aim and make assumptions on opponent movement, so the worse the decrease the worse the result. Smaller hard freezes (microfreezes) are still pretty bad and jarring, but the last video I saw with short freezes might have been the least impactful. Still, they're all terrible for a gamer.
