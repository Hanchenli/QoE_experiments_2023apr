In general, the stall defects in these videos were not as bad as those in previous iterations as it did not impact the ability to play the game as much as severe grades of stalls where the game is frozen for a prolonged period of time. Moreover, the bitrate defects in these videos were moderate so they were a bit more annoying than the stall defects, although in terms of playability stall defects generally detract more from the ability to play a game, but in this series of videos, the bitrate defects were a bit more annoying than the traditionally more annoying and detrimental category of stall defects.
