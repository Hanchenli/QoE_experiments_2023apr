Stall defects generally tend to make it more difficult to play a game since your progress is literally frozen and you don't know what the outcome of whatever action you executed is which makes it hard to figure out how to proceed in the game. Bitrate defects are annoying and more visually unappealing on an aesthetic front, however, to be fair they don't detract from playability as much as stall defects since one's progress in the game is not halted, but rather the visual depiction of your progress is blurrier, but not frozen. This study was easy to understand and well-designed.
