When it comes to quality damage I prefer to have a bit rate decrease over any kind of video stalling. With bit rate decrease you don't miss much of the action but when it stalls there is a high chance you could completely miss something awesome happening. Like in the overwatch clips you could end up missing a really cool shot because the video decided to stall. All the guidelines in this experiment were very clear and I understood the attention checks.
