I don't like bitrate decreases more than stalling, at least when it stalls I will eventually end up seeing everything. with bitrate decreases I'm permanently missing out on portions of the video that I can't see because it's too blurry. also I think I might have failed the first attention check by clicking "yes" when I meant to click "no" (on the excellent reference video) but I was paying attention the whole time!
