No problems or confusion about the guideline or grading system. As for the different kinds of quality damage and their effects, The initial delay never occurred, so I can't say much about that, but I can say that the intermittent stalls were a little annoying and I can see a marked difference in those examples with and without those moments. Although I never saw anything as bad as you had put into the instructive examples at the beginning of the HIT.
