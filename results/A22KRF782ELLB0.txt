I think the video stalling impacts the gameplay experience more since that will affect your response to the things you're seeing, and if there is significant stalling, that will impede your ability to play effectively (or enjoy watching someone else play). The bitrate decrease is annoying, but I would probably not be as bothered by that as long as the gameplay proceeds smoothly.
