The stall defects were a bit more tolerable in this series of videos since they video compensated with respect to speed once the stall defect ended, which is better than the alternative of normal game speed once the stall defect ends. The stall defects were more detrimental to game play since the game freezes and you cannot see whether your action had the intended outcome which impacts the ability to plan and execute your next move. Bitrate defects are objectively ugly but less harmful with respect to playability. The study was well-designed and engaging.
