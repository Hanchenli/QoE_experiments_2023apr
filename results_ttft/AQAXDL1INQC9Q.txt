If there isn't a delay or stall, watching is easy and I don't have any problems. The length of time the delay and stall last makes it harder to watch because it makes things stressful and uncomfortable. So the longer the reply takes makes it stressful and then the stall after depending on how long it is, would probably make me not want to use the chatbot if it takes too long. I think I answered everything correctly. I wasn't confused about the grading or attention checks.
