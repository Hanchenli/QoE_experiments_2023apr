Honestly, the glitches were not as annoying as one might think. The juxtaposition of both in  single video potentiated the irritation and made the experience worse as one might hypothesize. That being said, the delayed start glitch is quite benign and a non-issue when compared to the quality and experience degradation inflicted by intermittent stall glitches which literally interrupt the output in a random and unpredictable manner and greatly worsens the experience by making it more choppy and discombobulated.
