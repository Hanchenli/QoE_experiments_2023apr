The slow start causes some impatience and a degree of uncertainty as to whether I may have made a mistake in my input. Intermittent stoppage during the output makes me suspect that ChatGPT is making up the output such that it is not reliable. When the damage is less severe, it is easy to forgive the delay and not be affected by it. However, when there is more severe damage, it can affect the user experience to the point that the user may lose patience and not even bother to read the output. Significant intermittent delays as the output is being displayed can cause the user to lose focus on the output and even forget part of it so the user would have to re-read the entire output for a second time.
