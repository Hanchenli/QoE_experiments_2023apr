The diminished bitrate didn't bother me as much as the choppiness/delay did. If I'm playing a game, I need to not have skips and jumps in the video that make it more difficult to play. If the bitrate diminishes, then I can still play and my controls will be responsive, but that isn't necessarily the case when there are delays.
