The glitches were not as annoying as one might think, with the start glitch being rather innocuous comparatively. The juxtaposition of both in a  single video potentiated the irritation and made the experience worse as one might hypothesize. That being said, the delayed start glitch is quite benign and a non-issue when compared to the quality and experience degradation inflicted by intermittent stall glitches which literally interrupt the output in a random and unpredictable manner and greatly worsens the experience by making it more choppy and discombobulated.
