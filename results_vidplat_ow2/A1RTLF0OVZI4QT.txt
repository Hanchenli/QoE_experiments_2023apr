Video stalls are horrible for the enjoyment experience. They always seem to happen at the worst times and completely ruin the moment or immersion. I can handle some bitrate issues from time to time but the stalls are the worst. Like during the previous Overwatch video the constant stalls in the middle of the fight is just...anger inducing. Also I have no confusion about the grading as it seems pretty straightforward and easy to understand.
